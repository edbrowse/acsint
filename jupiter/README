This is a speech adapter, running in user space,
based on the acsint / acsbridge system.
It is modeled after the Jupiter speech adapter that use to live in the kernel,
but we don't have to be in the kernel any longer!

Type make, that should do the trick.
Then make install for /usr/local/bin/jupiter

This is a work in progress, well tested for some synthesizers,
and not even tried on others.

Full documentation is given in usersguide.html.
See sample.cfg for a sample configuration file.

You can exercise the text preprocessor, without running the adapter,
by running jupiter tts or jupiter ltts
ltts reads punctuation marks literally, every one of them.
That may sound like overkill, but that's what I do 99% of the time.
Perhaps because I'm a programmer - every punctuation mark matters.
Even when I read a story, I'd rather hear the word comma than a pause.

Use jupiter tc to test the syntax of the config file.

Run jupiter by itself for a usage message.
