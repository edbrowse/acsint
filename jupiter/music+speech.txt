This file documents hot keys for playing music on the Raspberry pi,
though it is applicable to other platforms.
And the hotkeys need not be jupiter based, you could use esekeyd for example,
or write your own program in user space to intercept keystrokes and take action.

It began in 2008 when we bought the mac, one of the best computers I ever owned,
relative to the needs of my entire family.
Pricy - but it was easy to use,
more intuitive than today's computers and cell phones, and it lasted a long time.
The keyboard had three keys at the upper right, which have since become standard.
Those keys raised and lowered volume, and paused the music.
You could be off in another application, doing homework, browsing the net, playing a game,
and still the music was always at your fingertips.
The phone rings - just hit pause.
someone comes in and wants to chat - lower the volume.
You don't have to switch to another tab or change context.
I wanted this capability on all my computers.

jupiter's config file supports a pipe syntax to run a command.
So the conceptual idea is:

sysrq|lower volume
scroll|raise volume
pause|pause music

Now those three buttons act just like the Mac.
I can be on some other console,working on a project,
and the music is still at my fingertips.
But how to implement?

Volume is controlled by /usr/bin/amixer,
and that program seems to change its syntax with every release.
It can be frustrating - but I read the man page,
determine the new syntax, and update jupiter's config file accordingly.
It's a minor maintenance every few years.
Here is the syntax that works on Raspbian 12 bookworm.
Your mileage may vary.

sysrq|amixer -q set master 3%-
scroll|amixer -q set master 3%+

A couple of aliases in .bashrc can read and set the volume.

alias auvol="amixer get Master | sed -e '/%/!d' -e '/Right/d' -e 's/%].*//' -e 's/.* \[//'"
alias auset="amixer -q set Master 60%"

Press the hot keys, volume up and down, and verify by auvol
that the volume is indeed changing.
Or try it while music is playing.

But there's another problem.
I naturally play music under my account, as a user, and once pipewire is launched,
root has no access to the mixer, or to the music programs in general,
such as play or mpg123 or mpv.
This was not a problem in earlier versions of Raspbian, but it is now.
And it seems to be insurmountable.
Therefore, jupiter cannot run as root.
In fact it must run as me.
Not just to access the mixer, but to access the sound card in general, for speech.
I use an external hardware synthesizer, but most people don't.
Most people use a software synth, such as espeakup,
so you have to have access to the sound card, else the computer remains silent.

That is not a show stopper.
It means root has to su to me when it launches jupiter,
and I thence have to have permissions on all the devices.
Now jupiter can speak through the sound card,
and it can, in parallel, control the hot keys to raise and lower volume.

Note that amixer controls over all volume,
while the volume of speech is handled by internal jupiter commands.
Thus you can control the volume of jupiter speech relative to your music,
and then you can control the overall volume.

+f2 incvol
sysrq|amixer -q set master 3%-
scroll|amixer -q set master 3%+

Here is my rc.local file that launches jupiter under my user account eklhad.
the devices mentioned herein should exist by udev.

# Grant me access to the audio devices, control through timer
chmod 666 /dev/snd/[c-t]*
chmod 666 /dev/acsint /dev/vcsa
# permission under /var/log, so I can debug
touch /var/log/acslog ; chmod 666 /var/log/acslog
# I use a hardware synth on the serial port through a usb serial converter.
chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0
su -c "XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000 /usr/local/bin/jupiter -d dbe u0 >/tmp/jupiter.log 2>&1" eklhad

The XDG variable is important here.
XDG_RUNTIME_DIR tells amixer where to find the pid of the running pipewire daemon.
It can't figure it out from my id alone.
But if XDG doesn't match my id, (eklhad = 1000), it prints an error and exits.
so you'd think it would just find the runtime directory for my account and move on, but no.
I have to explicitly set XDG_RUNTIME_DIR in jupiter's environment.

Now let's return to the pause button, which we have not addressed yet.
jupiter is a daemon process running in the background, and mpg123 (for example)
is a music player running under a console, in my case console 11.
If I happen to be in console 11, where the music is, I can hit space to pause and resume,
or other action keys, but I am almost always somewhere else.
In console 7 for example, writing this documentation.
Somehow the pause button must launch a program that communicates with mpg123,
(wherever it is), and send it a space key.
There is a lovely ioctl function that injects keystrokes into another terminal.
I wrote a program to take advantage of this function;
it is injkey.c (inject key) in this directory.
It's very short; feel free to read it.
make will compile it, and make install will install it.
The program is setuid root, because ironically, it has to run as root.
So I have to run jupiter as user, to access the sound card,
but then injkey has to run as root. Wow!
With that in place, here are the three hot keys.

sysrq|amixer -q set master 3%-
scroll|amixer -q set master 3%+
pause|/usr/local/bin/injkey 11 ' '

This assumes console 11 is devoted to music;
you may do things differently.

this is not limited to pause.
You can inject other characters (see man mpg123).
You can set hot keys to restart the song, jump to the previous song,
jump to the next song, skip ahead or back, etc.
As many hot keys as you care to dedicate to music -
although these are no longer available for your speech functions or other capabilities.
Remember to run mpg123 -q -C, for quiet mode and character response.
Here are three more keys assigned to previous song, restart song, next song.

k110|/usr/local/bin/injkey 11 d
k102|/usr/local/bin/injkey 11 b
k104|/usr/local/bin/injkey 11 f

This is not limited to mpg123.
If you prefer mpv, you can write hot keys to control that program instead.
Just read the man page to see what keys elicit what responses.
