The word acsint is shorthand for accessibility intercepter,
since the acsint system intercepts kernel events and makes the linux computer
more accessible to a wide range of disabilities.
The concept was developed by Saqib Shaikh in 2005, but did not
become practical until notifiers came on the scene in kernel 2.6.26.

There are two parts to the acsint system,
A device driver, which is documented in drivers/acsint.txt,
and a user space bridge layer, which is documented in bridge/acsbridge.h.
No need for me to repeat all that documentation here.

The tests directory contains a few test programs to exercise acsint,
without relying on any particular speech synthesizer.

I hope the device driver becomes part of the linux kernel, and the bridge
layer becomes a shared library, offered by many linux distributions.
That's my dream anyways.
To this end, the patch directory contains a patch to put the sounds
into the keyboard / pcspkr / event layer, where they belong.
This is probably a necessary first step.
If this patch is not accepted for any reason,
then ttyclicks has to keep making its own sounds, which works,
but is suboptimal.

The jupiter directory is my adapter, built upon the acsint system.

The doc directory has all the documentation.
doc/bootprocess.txt describes the process of setting up a fresh instance of Raspbian,
and much of this applies no matter what speech adapter you want to use.
You may want to read this first, and follow the directions
to build a talking raspberry pi, or any talking Linux machine.
Other files in the doc directory help you set up music on your computer,
along with hotkeys to play the songs.
There is a script to fetch podcast files,
which you can then play with mpg123 and your hotkeys.

It's all GPL so have fun with it.
